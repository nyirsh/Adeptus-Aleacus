# Adeptus-Aleacus
Warhammer is a game that involves a lot of math and statistics and we're not all good at it.
Is my weapon good against that target? What are my changes of surviving that attack? How do these two units compare to each other?
Look no further, browse to [Adeptus Aleacus](https://nyirsh.github.io/Adeptus-Aleacus) and let the website calculate all of those difficult numbers for you!
Oh, did I mention it's mobile friendly too?

I don't like asking for money, reason why you won't find this button on the website itself but if you found this tool useful and you wish to say thanks just... buy me a coffee! I'll be infinitevily grateful to you and I'll convert all of that caffeine into more code!
